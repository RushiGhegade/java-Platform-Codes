Description:
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only
number in the range that is missing from the array.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range
[0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range
[0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 3:
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range
[0,9]. 8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Constraints:
n == nums.length

1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.
